Title: DVWA Lab — Full Report (Task 3) — Exploitation & Remediation (Security = Low)

Short description (one line):
Comprehensive DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) lab report with step-by-step exploitation, evidence, and developer-ready remediations for SQLi, XSS (reflected & stored), CSRF, LFI/RFI, Burp Suite testing, and security headers — accompanied by an explanation video.

What this repo contains

report.md — Full, detailed DVWA lab report (steps, payloads, evidence placeholders, remediation).

slides/ — Optional slide deck (if included or generated later).

evidence/ — Placeholder filenames for screenshots and curl outputs (drop your captured files here).

video/ — Explanation video (or link/notes to hosted video).

scripts/ — Helpful scripts used in the lab (e.g., serve_attack_page.sh, capture_headers.sh) — (optional).

LICENSE — Recommended: MIT (or choose your preferred license).

README.md — This file (overview + how to reproduce the lab locally).

Why this repo

This repository documents hands-on exploitation of common web vulnerabilities in a controlled DVWA lab and provides concise, actionable fixes developers can apply during development and staging. It’s ideal for students, instructors, and engineers building secure web apps or learning web security basics.

Quick start (reproduce locally)

Prerequisites

Debian/Ubuntu or Kali-based system

Apache, PHP, MySQL (or MariaDB)

DVWA package or clone from official DVWA repo

Burp Suite (community or pro) for manual testing

Steps (short)

Install dependencies and DVWA (see report.md for full commands).

Configure /var/www/html/DVWA/config/config.inc.php and run http://127.0.0.1/DVWA/setup.php.

Set Security = Low on DVWA.

Follow report.md for each module, payloads, and how to capture evidence (screenshot filenames given).

Add your screenshots to evidence/ matching the filenames in the report.

How the explanation video helps

The explanation video walks through:

Lab setup and verification

Live demonstration of each vulnerability (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, LFI/RFI)

Burp Suite workflow (Intercept, Repeater, Intruder)

Applying recommended remediations and re-checking security headers

Practical developer tips and testing checklist

Safety & ethics

Only run these tests in controlled environments you own or have explicit permission to test. Never target production systems or third-party infrastructure.
